# Amazon_Clone_Static_Webpage
This project is a static front-end clone of the Amazon homepage, created to practice and demonstrate proficiency in HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the visual layout and core design of Amazon's user interface, focusing on clean code, modern styling techniques, and responsive elements.
